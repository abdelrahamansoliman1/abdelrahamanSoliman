Hello, This is Abdelrahaman Soliman, a Junior Web developer, passionate to become a full stack engineer.
I have been doing web development since my graduation from my high school,
and I gotta tell you that specializing in that field in computer engineering in general was the best thing I have ever done.
even though I'm still learning, but at the same time, I enjoy coding, I enjoy putting all of my effort into a web site that is not build by mind, but it's bulit by heart.
